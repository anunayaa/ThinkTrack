# ThinkTrack
End-to-end ML pipeline for customer behavior classification with feature engineering, model tuning, and GUI deployment.



**ThinkTrack** is a  machine learning-based application that predicts customer behavior based on demographic and financial attributes. This project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction using PCA, model evaluation across multiple algorithms, and deployment via a Tkinter-based GUI for real-time predictions.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Analyze and preprocess customer data to extract meaningful patterns.
- Train and compare classification models to predict customer intent or behavior.
- Reduce feature dimensionality using PCA to improve performance and reduce complexity.
- Deploy the best-performing model using a simple graphical interface.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains anonymized customer information with the following key features:

- Age  
- Gender  
- Estiamated Salary 
- Purchase History

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn** – EDA and data manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn** – Modeling, evaluation, PCA  
- **Tkinter** – GUI deployment

---

## 📊 Machine Learning Models

The following algorithms were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)  
- Random Forest Classifier  


Model performance was assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and cross-validation scores.
